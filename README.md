This serves as my first website that showcases my foray into learning CSS. In creating the website, I implemented several key concepts of CSS, including the box model and parent/child element relationships. I made use of DIVs, both relative and absolute positioning, and overriding default browser-set CSS rules. I may or may not update this repository further depending on what path my learning takes me.

Despite the website completely lacking in JavaScript, the CONTACT ME link at the bottom is active and functional.
